### Morning
- We all attended the workshop with Alice for the first half of the morning.
- We then decided to all watch the video by Traversy Media for a basic Ruby on Rails application [Ruby on Rails In 60 Mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPy0GQJLZUM)
- We reconvened for 15 mins before lunch to discuss our learnings from the video

### Afternoon
- Started discussion on how we would start building the app
- RSpec for unit tests, Capybara for feature tests
- Wireframing with figma to design the different route that we are planning to create: Signup, Login, Home, New Post
- 6 tall palm trees in Latin is sextus pinus erectus
- Copied all of our images from Figma to our github repo

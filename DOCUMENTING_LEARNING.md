# Documenting Learnings

## 22 February 2021
### Morning
* Started with a general collaborative info-gathering session to ensure we're all on the same page.
* Decided our team name would be [Hemoglobin Trotters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgYSueh4w_Y)
* Forked [repo](https://github.com/Mornevanzyl/acebook-hemoglobin-trotters), invited collaborators and renamed it.
* Selected a markdown document hosted on our project repo to document project learnings.
* Selected Trello to host our project [Card Wall](https://trello.com/b/k5BoEoPi/acebook)

### Afternoon
* Basic planning session to start compiling user stories from user supplied cards
